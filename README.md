# OhLang
Oh is a natural language transpiler experiment written in Python with the help of textgenrnn.

# Conclusion
The concepts of Oh might be possible with a better dataset/model, but natural language is hard to interpret, and hard to write a full program in... A lot of vagueness is embedded in natual language, and I've come to realize this. Natural language is not suitable for programming in. :)
